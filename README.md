# Paginate.js Documentation

Display any html content without pre-formatting in a paginated view & generate exact print-previews with focus on reliability & performance. Paginate.js does not aim to replicate the dynamic behavior of a browser's print preview. Instead, it converts the html content into a static, paginated preview, ensuring that the layout remains consistent and unaltered when printed.
