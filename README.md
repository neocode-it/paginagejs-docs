# Paginate.js Documentation

[Paginate.js](https://github.com/neocode-it/paginatejs)  is a powerful JavaScript library crafted to display HTML content in a paginated view while delivering precise print previews. Prioritizing reliability and performance, Paginate.js  ensures that the layout remains consistent and unaltered when printed. Unlike a browser's dynamic print preview, Paginate.js  generates a static, paginated representation of your content, maintaining its integrity for print-focused applications. Whether you're building professional reports, printable templates, or static document views, Paginate.js  is designed to meet your needs with confidence.
